# Initial NEU site

To set up a development and build environment:

    % gem install sass
    % npm install -g bower
    % npm install -g grunt-cli
    % npm install
    % bower install

Note that I made a fix to grunt-data-uri which, as of this commit, has not yet
been released upstream. The fix is on [my branch][], and there is a relevant
[issue][] and [pull request][].
